# Atoms-React

This is a port of the Atari ST game 
[Atoms](http://www.atarimania.com/game-atari-st-atoms_31125.html)
by B. Hewlett.

> The object of this game is to wipe out the other players' ATOMS
> by causing a chain reaction. To do this you overload a square: 
> Corner squares overload with 2 ATOMS,
> side squares  with 3 ATOMS,
> middle squares with 4 ATOMS.
> When a player's ATOMS are wiped out, that player is out of the game.
